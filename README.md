# toyoyo
a programming language made in Python.
just for fun, i wanted to see if i can make a programming language :^)
it's in alpha stage now, but it's enough to set variables and print them!

## usage
make a `.tyy` file, put all the code in and run `python toyoyo.tyy <path>`.
if you are working on a pull request, you can use `-d` to have a view of current tokens proccessed.

## examples
a classic "Hello world!" script:
```
// initalizing the variable with text
text := "Hello world!"

// printing it out
yell text
```
calculating the surface area of ​​a triangle:
```
// length of the base side of a triangle
a := 5

// height of a triangle
h := 3

P := a * h / 2
yell P
```
see more examples in the `examples/` folder!
